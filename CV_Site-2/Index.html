        <p>Hello! </p>
        <p>I'm Carolyn, a Brooklyn-based all around creative type. I love to build beautiful websites, can turn a nice phrase, and like making things.</p>
        <p>When I'm not working to make the world a better-looking and more functional place, I'm doing something with food, taking pictures, training for an OCR, supporting my Nerds, knitting, or lavishing belly rubs upon my very spoiled dachshund. </p>

        <p>Experience</p>

        <p>I am a marketing, copywriting and design professional with over 12 years&#39; experience working in a wide variety of markets. I have strong marketing, writing, editing, web design, web management, and social media skills. I am also adept at cultivating relationships with business leaders, vendors, contractors, promoters and industry professionals and have served as the client and vendor-facing point person in a number of roles. I work well both independently and as part of a team, and am used to working under a deadline with evolving goals. I enjoy metrics and market research, and am a stickler for brand consistency (especially where design is concerned). </p>
