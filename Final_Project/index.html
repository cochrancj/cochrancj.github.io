<p>INTRO COPY EXPLAINING THE SITE - In omni memoria patriae religionis sunt diri undead historiarum. Golums, zombies et fascinati. Maleficia! Vel a modern perhsaps morbi. A terrenti contagium. Forsitan illud Apocalypsi, vel malum poenae horrifying fecimus. Indeflexus monstra per plateas currere. Fit de nostra carne undead. Poenitentiam agite p≈ìnitentiam! Vivens mortua sunt apud nos.</p>

<h3>Chicken</h3>
<p>Start with boneless, skinless chicken thighs. If your cooking style is sautee, stir-fry, or soup; cut into bite-sized pieces before cooking. If your cooking style is braise, roast or slow cook; leave whole. Whatever cooking method is chosen, take care to cook the chicken all the way through.</p>

<h4>Avocado</h4>
<p>To test the ripeness of your avocado: squeeze the flesh slightly. A ripe avocado will give a little. Unripe avocados remain rock hard. You don't want an unripe avocado. To prepare: INSERT A VIDEO LINK?? For our purposes, cut into bite-sized pieces - add in the last few minutes if your cooking style comes up sautee or stir-fry; use as more of a garnish if your cooking style comes up brasie, soup, roast or slow cook.</p>

<h5>Broccoli</h5>
<p>Wash and chop into florets. The stalk of broccoli is also delicious - cut the outside skin away so you have a square and chop into bite sized pieces. </p>

<div class="ingredient-expanded">
<h6>Stir-Fry</h6>
<p>Grab a wok or your largest and heaviest frying pan. Set the heat to high, and add a couple Tablespoons of a fat with a high smoke point (sesame oil is great for Asian style cooking; grapeseed or avocado oil is a nice neutral base for other cooking types). When the pan is hot (almost smoking), add your ingredients. Take care to continually stir your food to avoid burning. Your dinner is done when your protein is cooked through and your veggies are softened and browned in spots.</p>

<h7>Thai</h7>
<p>
Juice of 1 lime<br>
2 Tbsp. Fish sauce (Red Boat brand is paleo-friendly)<br>
2 Tbsp. Coconut aminos<br>
1-2 Tbsp. sriracha<br>
2 cloves garlic, minced<br>
1/2 inch knob ginger, peeled and minced<br>
2 Tbsp. cilantro, chopped (optional)
</p>
<p>If you are sauteeing or stir-fry-ing: Add the garlic and ginger before you add your protein and veggies. Let cook 1 - 2 minutes.</p>
<p>When your protein and veggies have been added and have been cooking a few minutes (about halfway done), add the fish sauce, lime juice, and coconut aminos). Let cook until the liquid has evaporated</p>
<p>Add the cilantro and sriracha after your dinner is cooked to its desired doneness.</p>
<p>If you are braising, roasting, slow-cooking or turning this dish into a soup, add the Thai seasoning ingredients at the beginning of the cooking process. Use the lime juice, sriracha and cilantro as more of a garnish after your dish has been cooked.</p>
